deardata 100 project average screen time

Why I choose this topic:
I chose to sisualise the average screen time per day because as technology advances we spend a lot more time on the internet specifically our phones which we rely on 
and carry in our pocket most of the time. So I wanted to know how much time people spend on their phone on average in a day.

How and what I collected:
I didn't get 100 pieces of data i only got 72. I collected the number of hours the person spends on their phone on average a day by asking people what their screen time is
and using the screen time feature in the phone settings.
I collected the hour in notes and rounded it up to the nearest hour and converted it into minutes as there were some people who had a screen time of less than one hour so it will be easier
to display all the pieces of data as they are all in minutes.

Visual idea:
city skyline bar chart
Stacked bars where: each person is a vertical bar, the bar height is the screen time, alternative colours for different time ranges so it's easy to identify.
Height = screen time
colour:
Green = low (≤ 200 mins)
Blue = average (201–500 mins)
Red = high (> 500 mins) 

Tools used:
java/processing	
Github for processing control

Reflection:
The visualisation shows a wide variety in screen time usage. The tallest red bars makes the highest screen time stand out. But overall most people fall into the medium to high range. 
This sketch helped me learn how to design and visualization of data with java, and make personal data meaningful.
